1) windows_runCvi.slrm:		Manages input parameters and launches simulations and processing of simulated output (cvi_toHa_windows.py)
2) cvi_toHa_windows.py:		Launches simulations and processes the simulated output
3) ghost_ageInWindows.R:	Computes statistics and plots the fit between observed and simulated ages across genomic windows
