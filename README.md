Authors: Andrea Fulgione1,2,3*, Célia Neto1*, Ahmed F. Elfarargi1, Emmanuel Tergemina1, Mehmet Göktay1, Herculano Dinis4,5, Nina Döring1, Pádraic J. Flood1‡, Sofia Rodriguez-Pacheco1, Nora Walden6§, Markus Koch6, Fabrice Roux7, Joachim Hermisson2, Angela M. Hancock1,2†

The analyses are based on a vcf file shared in EVA (European Variation Archive).
