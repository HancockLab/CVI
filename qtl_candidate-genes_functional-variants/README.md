#	QTLs, candidate genes and functional variants: 
###

We conducted a literature review of studies that used the Cvi-0 x Ler-0 RILs and, based on these studies and fine mapping, we compiled a list of QTL regions, candidate genes and functional variants. 
Then, we tested the percentage of private variation across functional categories
