## SLiM scripts

SLiM version 3.3.2 was used to simulate different selfing-rates and how these affect the trajectories of the mutation of interest. 

The SLiM scripts are split into 4k generations and 1k generations which are stored in the 4k and 1k directories respectively.

Each folder contains the different selfing rates scripts shown as (90, 95 and 99) indicating the selfing rate that it simulates.
